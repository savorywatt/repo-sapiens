"""Integration tests for end-to-end workflows.

This package contains comprehensive integration tests that verify complete
automation workflows, including:

- End-to-end issue processing workflows
- Credential resolution and management
- Git operations (branches, commits, PRs)
- Template rendering and application
- Configuration loading and overrides
- Error recovery and state management

Tests use mocked external services to ensure isolation and repeatability
while simulating realistic scenarios.

See test_workflow_e2e.py for comprehensive integration test suite.
