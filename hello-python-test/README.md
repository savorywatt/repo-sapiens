**PLACEHOLDER PACKAGE - Version 0.0.2**

> *The evolved, intelligent way to manage repositories*

This is a placeholder package while we clean up and prepare the full repo-sapiens package for release.

The complete repo-sapiens automation tool will be available in the coming week. This minimal version is published to reserve the package name and test our PyPI distribution workflow.

## What's Coming

**repo-sapiens** will be a comprehensive automation tool for repository management and project workflows. Like *Homo sapiens* evolved beyond their predecessors, repo-sapiens brings intelligent, evolved repository automation.

Stay tuned for the full release!

## Current Status

This v0.0.2 release contains only basic placeholder functionality:

```python
from repo_sapiens import greet, get_greeting

greet()  # Simple hello world functionality
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install repo-sapiens
```

**Note**: This is a placeholder release. The full-featured package will be released soon.
